\makeproblem{Transition from near- to far-field.}{modernOptics:problemSet2:4}{
Consider the intensity distribution behind an illuminated  single slit whose width is \(A = 10 \lambda\). Immediately behind the slit, the intensity matches the transmission profile. Farther away, there will be diffraction patterns. Assume the illumination is plane-wave, with intensity \(I_0\), and monochromatic. Make a {\bf numerical calculation} of the intensity pattern \(I = | \Psi |^2 \) using the exact diffraction integral,
\(\) \Psi = \frac{\Psi_0}{i \lambda} \int_{-A/2}^{A/2} dx' \frac{e^{i k R}}{R} \(\)
where \(R = |\Br - \Br'|\) as in the notes, but we have restricted the problem to the plane (\(y=0\)).

When making plots, plot all lengths in units of \(\lambda\)  (ie, plot intensity \(I/I_0\) versus \(x/\lambda\)). Ignore the \(y\) direction. For each observation distance, comment on the validity of the approximations. Each plot should have an exact line, a Fresnel line, and a Fraunhofer line.

For each of the following observation distances, {\bf compare} your calculation to the Fresnel and Fraunhofer approximations:
