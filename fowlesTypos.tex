for a nice collection of errata notes for \citep{fowles1989introduction}.

Two others:
\begin{itemize}
\item page 137: equation (5.52)
A factor of \(k/L\) was dropped from the exponential.
\item It also seems to me that Fowles (3.45) has an additional factor of \(1/\sqrt{2 \pi}\) and that the \(1/\sqrt{2\pi}\) in (3.46) should have no square root (both on page 81).
%\item Go check the book for stuff I marked up... am sure there was more.  Add emailed Prof about at least one of these.
\end{itemize}
