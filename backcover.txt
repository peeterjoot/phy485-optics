This book is based on my lecture notes for the Fall 2012 session of University of Toronto Advanced Classical Optics course (PHY485H1F), taught by Prof. Joseph H. Thywissen.

Official course description:

"This course builds on a student's knowledge of basic electromagnetic theory by focusing attention on light including elementary aspects of the propagation of optical beams and their interaction with matter.  We examine light polarization, coherence, interference and diffraction as we move towards a description of lasers within a semiclassical picture in which the fields are treated classically and matter is treated quantum mechanically.  In between we discuss Gaussian beam modes and their relation to optical resonators as well as fibre and slab waveguides."

This book contains a few things
- Plain old lecture notes.
- Personal notes exploring concepts from the lectures or texts.
- Assigned problems.
- Some worked problems attempted as course prep, for fun, or for exam preparation, or post exam review.
- Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with course content or these notes.
