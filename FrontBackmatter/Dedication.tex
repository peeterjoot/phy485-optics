    Dedicated to:

\par
    Mom.  You are a force of nature.  You raised me by example, illustrating that any goal was possible once the decision to achieve it had been made, irrespective of any obstacles.  The path to that goal might be a rough slog, but I knew that perseverance and hard work would get me there in the end.
